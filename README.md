# HERE AND NOW

Here + Now is a tactile auditory experience inviting participants to be gentle and focus on the present moment, by directly squeezing the music they hear.

RCA / ICL Gizmo 2021 for GID / IDE 2022

Made with Bela mini

## Project description

The device puts a direct link from touch to audio, slowly destroying the music as the user squeezes. The experience invites you to let go a little and be gentle - the original music can only be heard when touching as lightly as possible, asking you to reflect on prescence and the present moment, and the feeling of losing something just as you hope to hold it tighter.

Made with a Bela Mini cape and PocketBeagle for Global Innovation Design's Gizmo module. Recorded directly from line out instead of mic'ing the 2 internal speakers. Audio from Local Native's track "When Am I Gonna Lose You", with original audio recorded for the "mangled" version of the track purpose made to subtly strengthen the impact of the audio falling apart.

## Configuring the Bela mini

The pins used for the HX711 must be set to gpio at boot time:
